# Flutter AR Furniture E-Commerce App

Welcome to my Flutter-based Augmented Reality (AR) Furniture E-Commerce App for furniture shopping. This mobile application seamlessly combines the worlds of furniture shopping and augmented reality to provide users with an immersive and interactive shopping experience.

**NOTE:** I developed this project for Gemona West Lifestyle, the interior design firm where I currently work. It will be available on the Play Store by January. Once it is finally on the Play Store, I'll add the link here for you all to download and shop in 3D.

I am also working on creating a youtube channel where I'll teach people flutter and we'll create cool projects and flutter packages! together. The link will be added to all my repository README.md when it is up.
